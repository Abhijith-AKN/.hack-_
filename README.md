# .hack-_
Project and protoype made while .hack()_24 was held.

This is a basic code for object detection and voice announcement
Referance has taken from the internet, chatgpt, etc.
I have used yolov3.cfg, yolov3.weights and coco.names.
Also here is a text-to-speech engine, pyttsx3
Also implemented some techiniques to make it more optimized and real-time.
